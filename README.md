# Anti-Spoofing-Project
This repository contains the project of anti spoofing that i have done during computer vision course at university  
In this project we use two methods :  
1. extract some features and then train the model with those features
2. just pass the images to the model and train it  
We use **MobileNet** as model in the project and you can see the results in CSV's files.  
Thanks to my teammate in this project , @iMahdiGhazavi we did this project.
